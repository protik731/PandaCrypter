# PandaCrypter
PandaCrypter is a C#-based tool designed to convert PowerShell scripts into obfuscated batch files (.bat) with encryption and additional features for execution control. 

# Features
- [x] PowerShell to Batch Conversion: Converts PowerShell scripts `(.ps1)` into batch files `(.bat)`.
- [x] AES Encryption: Encrypts the PowerShell payload.
- [x] Anti-VM: Optionally evades virtualized environments.
- [x] Compression: Compresses the payload to reduce size before encryption.
- [x] Obfuscation: Obfuscates the generated batch file and powershel execution chain. 
- [x] AMSI Bypass: Optionally includes an `AMSI` (Antimalware Scan Interface) bypass to avoid detection.
- [x] Run as Administrator: Supports elevating privileges by prompting for admin rights using `Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism` [Force Admin](https://github.com/Chainski/ForceAdmin).
- [x] Self-Deletion: Optionally self-destructs after execution.
- [x] Persistence: Optionally registers the batch file to run at user logon via scheduled tasks.
- [x] Windows Defender Exclusion: Can add an exclusion path to Windows Defender (requires admin privileges).
- [x] Execution Delay: Supports adding a delay before script execution.
- [x] Low Entropy Packing: Contains colon padding to reduce entropy

# Tested with Red-Team Tools 
- [x] [Hoaxshell](https://github.com/t3l3machus/hoaxshell)

# Usage
PandaCrypter is a command-line tool that requires an input PowerShell script and outputs a batch file. Below is the syntax and available options.

```batch
PandaCrypter -i <input.ps1> -o <output.bat> [options]
```

# Options
```
-amsi: Enables AMSI bypass in the generated batch file.
-antivm: Evades virtualized environments.
-admin: Configures the batch file to request administrative privileges.
-selfdelete: Adds self-deletion logic to remove the batch file after execution.
-startup: Registers the batch file to run at user logon using a scheduled task.
-defender_exclusion: Adds an exclusion path to Windows Defender for the ProgramData directory.
-sleep: Introduces a 10-second delay before executing the payload.
```

# How It Works
PandaCrypter processes a PowerShell script through several stages to produce an obfuscated batch file:

- Input Reading: Reads the input PowerShell script (.ps1) as text.
- Compression: Compresses the script using `GZip` to reduce its size.
- Encryption: Encrypts the compressed payload.
- Stub Generation: Creates a PowerShell stub that:
- Decodes the encrypted payload from Base64.
- Decrypts it using the provided `key` and `IV`.
- Decompresses the result.
- Executes the final PowerShell code using IEX `(Invoke-Expression)`.
- Batch Obfuscation: Embeds the PowerShell stub in a batch file, applying:
- Random variable names for obfuscation.
- Splitting commands into smaller parts assigned to variables.
- Random case variation for PowerShell command strings (e.g., pOwErShElL).
- Feature Integration: Adds optional features like `AMSI bypass`, `admin elevation`, or `self-deletion` based on command-line flags.
- Output: Writes the final batch file with the encrypted payload appended as a Base64-encoded string, prefixed with `::` .

# Installation
Clone the repository or download the prebuilt binary produced by github actions:
```
git clone https://github.com/chainski/PandaCrypter.git
```
Open the solution in Visual Studio or another C# IDE.
Build the project to generate the executable (PandaCrypter.exe).
Run the tool from the command line with the desired options.

# Example Output
For an input PowerShell script hello.ps1 containing:

```powershell
Write-Host "Hello, World!"
```

```batch
PandaCrypter -i hello.ps1 -o hello.bat -amsi
```

Produces `hello.bat`, which, when executed, runs the original script while bypassing `AMSI`.
